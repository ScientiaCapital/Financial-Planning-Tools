## Technologies


Before attempting to execute any Python code in risk_return_analysis.ipynb, it is imperative that your development environment holds the following modules:

[requests](https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/) - HTTPs request module

[json](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) - .json encoder and decoder module

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - Data analysis module

[dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) - .env file parser module

[alpaca_trade_api](https://pypi.org/project/alpaca-trade-api/) - Python library for the Alpaca Commission Free Trading API

[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Data visualization module

[seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - Statistical data visualization module

## Usage

1. Clone repository onto your personal machine. 

2. Open _Jupyter Lab_ or _Jupyter Notebook_ via _Anaconda Navigator_ and navigate to the directory in which the file `financial_planning_tools.ipynb` is present. _All relevant code for this repository will be executed via Jupyter Notebook and no output will be printed to the command line_. Ensure that all relevant dependencies and _Python_ modules are installed (see __Technologies__ and __Installation Guide__ for more details) before attempting to execute code within _Jupyter Notebook_; otherwise, you will receive multiple interpreter errors! 

3. With the notebook open, start at the very first cell reading "__Analyzing Portfolio Risk and Return__" (a cell will be active when a rectangular border is surrounding the area in question). Run each cell in sequential order. _It is vital that all cells are ran in sequential order or your notebook will generate compiler errors_!.
